          <h1>THE FLOOD CRISIS IN SYLHET NOW</h1>
          <p>
            The last couple of weeks have been nothing less than hell on Earth
            for the residents of Sylhet and Sunamganj due to the violent flood
            that has shown no mercy. <br /><br />
            This devastating flood has made its place in history by showcasing
            its wrath, gaining the throne of the queen of all floods in the 122
            years flood history of Sylhet. At this moment, more than 80% of
            Sylhet and more than 90% of Sunamganj is under water.
